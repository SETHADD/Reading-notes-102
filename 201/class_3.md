**inline**- Allows elements beside it but doesn't take margins top and bottom.  
**inline-block**- Allows elements beside it but unlike _inline,_ it allows margins top and bottom of it.  
We learnt the importance of not keeping the _height_ values absolute but rather as a *percentage*  

**overflow**- when the overflow is set to _scroll_ it allows scrolling of overflowed conrent.
